            We are a group of people with decades of experience in growing and
            selling blueberries. We know what a good blueberry looks like and how they
            are grown. This essential fruit requires a temperate climate, loamy
            soil that is rich in organic matter apart from needing proper
            drainage and aeration facilities. Lucky for us we live in Kashmir
            which is proudly known as paradise of earth is also home to
            temperate fruits like apple for which the state is very famous
            across globe. The main factor which influence temperate fruit
            bearing bushes is soil, climate and environment which are highly
            favorable and unparalleled in the province of Kashmir. Kashmiri
            apples a unique look, taste, flavor, size and color.
